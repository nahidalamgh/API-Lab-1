This code was downloaded from the library called PixiJS (www.pixijs.com). Changed the motive on the code and tried out a couple of things, for example, changing the scales on "onClick". I also changed the initial position. 

This can be useful in different applications and websites in order to read small text, as in medical descriptions for example.
