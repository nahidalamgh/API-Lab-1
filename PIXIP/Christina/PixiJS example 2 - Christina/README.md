This code was downloaded from the library called PixiJS (https://pixijs.io/examples/#/interaction/click.js). 

I changed the motive on the code and tried out a couple of things, for example, changing the scales on "onClick". I also changed the initial position underneath "anchor.set". 

This can be useful in different applications and websites in order to read small text, as in medical descriptions for example.
