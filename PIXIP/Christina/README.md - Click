This code was downloaded from the library called PixiJS (www.pixijs.com). Changed the motive on the code and I did
try to implement so you were able to zoom out the motive (in the original you can only zoom in) but I did not succeed. 
Greta, in my group, however succeded with that so luckliy I got to learn how to do that as well. 

This can be useful in different applications and websites in order to read small text, as in medical descriptions for example.
