This code was downloaded from the library called PixiJS 
"https://pixijs.io/examples/#/filters-basic/displacement-map-crawlies.js" and changed in a context to use for magnificaiton. 

I experimented a bit with the code and ended up with changing the motive, making it lighter, 
additionally changing the shape of the magnifying glass from a circle to a square. 
By changing the shape I also changed the visibility of it in because i didnt want it to be as blurry as in their example.

It can be useful in different websites and also games for magnifying anything, as in my example that I downloaded from
PixiJS), a map.
