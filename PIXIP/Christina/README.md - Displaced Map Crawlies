This code was downloaded from the library called PixiJS 
"https://pixijs.io/examples/#/filters-basic/displacement-map-crawlies.js" and changed in a context to use for magnificaiton. 

I changed the motive, made it lighter, additionally changing the shape of the magnifying glass from a circle to a square. 
Changed the size of it by changing the scales on displacementfilter.scale ".x" and ".y". 

It can be useful in different websites and also games for magnifying anything, as in my example that I downloaded from
PixiJS), a map.
