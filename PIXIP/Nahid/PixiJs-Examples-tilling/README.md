In this example of tiling the purpose was to arrange identical plane images so that they completely cover the canvas without overlapping.
At first PIXI app method was called
For storing the image PIXI.Texture method was created
Then the start point of tiling the texture/image was set to 0,
and every time the image hits the canvas boundary it will scale either two times smaller or two times larger.
