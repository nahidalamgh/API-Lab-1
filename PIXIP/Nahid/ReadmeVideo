In this eaxmple I have created a custom player button. Usually a player button in HTML is built in but in this case the player button
has been modifeid or drawn in a new way.
I started creating play buttuon by drwaing an eclipse in the canvas with PIXI.js Graphics method, 
then a started to draw a triangle in the middle. T
The main challenge here was to positining the trianggle inside the eclipse. 
Then I positoned the total graphics in the middle.
The main benefit of using pixi,js graphics is that you can very easily apply own style guide which is difficult in JAvaScript.
