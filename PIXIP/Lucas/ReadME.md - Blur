  
The JavaScript code is created to blur out some parts of the image. 
The parts that is non-blured will fade into being blured. 
And the blured part will become on-blured.

The Blur project is based on a image that is supplied by PIXI and it displays how the blur function works.

The Blur project could be used for a variaty of different things such as, "Notifications, important pop-ups and hiding
critical information".
