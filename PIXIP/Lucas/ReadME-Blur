The JavaScript code is created to blur out some parts of the image, the blured part will then revert to a non-blured part
and the non-blured part will become blured.

The Blur project is based on a image that is supplied by PIXI and it displays how the blur function works.

The Blur project could be used for a variaty of different things such as, "Notifications, important pop-ups and hiding
critical information".
