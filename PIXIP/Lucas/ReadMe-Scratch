The JavaScript code is created to hide whats underneath the first layer of the image, once the user presses the mousebutton 
and hovers over the image, the image underneath the black screen will show. 

The Scratch project is based on a scratch lottery function where the user can scratch the
top layer of the image and the bottom layer will remain intact. 

The scratch project could be used for a variaty of different things such as, games, lottery tickets, events where you want the 
user to experiance something uniqe and fun. 

This project is exploring the possibilities in using an API, making small changes
and personalizing it to make it more useful for a more broad situation. 

How users can get started with the project



How to use your code
When trying another script, you will have to change the name of the second script inside of the index.html document.
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
 <script src="pixi.min.js"></script>
 <script src="Container.js"></script>   // THIS ONE HAS TO BE CHANGED IN ORDER TO TRY DIFFERENT SCRIPTS.
 <script type="text/javascript">
    let type="WebGL"
    if(!PIXI.utils.isWebGLSupported()){
    type = "canvas"
    }
    
    PIXI.utils.sayHello (type)
    let app = new PIXI.Application({width:800, height 800});
