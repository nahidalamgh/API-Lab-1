This code was downloaded from the library called PixiJS "https://pixijs.io/examples/?v=v5.2.1#/filters-basic/blur.js" and changed in a context to use for bluring images.

The JavaScript code is created to blur out some parts of the image. 
The parts that is non-blured will fade into being blured. 
And the blured part will become on-blured.

The Blur project is based on a image that i created and it displays how the blur function works.
You could blur some parts of the image or just the whole image.

The Blur project could be used for a variaty of different things such as, "Notifications, important pop-ups and hiding
critical information".
