README for Click 
By Greta Backaityte

The Example code was taken from the PixiJS library ( https://pixijs.io/examples/#/interaction/click.js ). 

The example was chosen because I saw potential real life use for it with some changes. In this project I explored the user value that 
this example could create with implementation of  feedback as well as introducing limitations that could serve a specific purpose. 
The intended use for this project is to function as a magnifying glass.

The project only opens on MS Edge browser. I did not know how to fix this issue, but it does work on that browser.
